# Stuff I wrote

## Literate Programming
I was an early supporter of the [LiteratePrograms](http://en.literateprograms.org) website.  I was user 
[RossPatterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20071107115630/http://en.literateprograms.org/User:RossPatterson),
active around 2007.  LiteratePrograms got lost around 2010, and was recreated later, without any wiki features and with no history.
Luckily, the Internet Archive captures everything.

I created several small programs there:
* ["Hello World" in Rexx](https://web.archive.org/web/20100710000500/http://en.literateprograms.org/Hello_World_%28Rexx%29)
* [Soundex in Rexx](https://web.archive.org/web/20100710002950/http://en.literateprograms.org/Soundex_%28Rexx%29)
* [NYSIIS in Rexx](https://web.archive.org/web/20100710022748/http://en.literateprograms.org/New_York_State_Identification_and_Intelligence_System_%28Rexx%29)
* [Word count in Rexx](https://web.archive.org/web/20100709011915/http://en.literateprograms.org/Word_count_%28Rexx%29)
* [Word count in Forth](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106135819/http://en.literateprograms.org/Word_count_%28Forth%29)
	
## CruiseControl.net
(now at https://ccnet.github.io/CruiseControl.NET/projects/ccnet/wiki.html)
Circa 2008, I was the release manager, I think for release 1.3.
I created the [AccuRev source control interface](https://ccnet.github.io/CruiseControl.NET/projects/ccnet/wiki/Accurev.html) 

## John Fisher's wonderful VMARC utility
I was part of the VM/CMS systems programming community for years during the last century, and I did some work to make [John Fisher's wonderful VMARC utility](https://github.com/RossPatterson/VMARC) more reliably Y2K compliant.

## A native mainframe webserver
I worked in one group with several different corporate overlords for about 13 years.  We focused solely on tools for IBM's VM/CMS environment, many of them systems management tools.
But in 1995, the group then known as Sterling Software Inc's VM Software Division released a mainframe native webserver that I designed and the I and two others wrote.
From scratch, using no code from any of the existing webservers on any platform.
Sterling called it "VM:Webserver" at first (and later "VM:WebGateway"), and it did pretty well for quite a few years.
A later corporate overlord killed it, and as far as I know, there are no instances of it left on the web.

# About me
As to who I am, I'm the Ross Patterson you used to [find on the web most of the time](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ross+a.+patterson%22).
I've been an active and occasionally noisy geek since at least 1972, when I was lucky enough to encounter an [IBM 1130](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130) computer system at [Stuyvesant High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School).
Until 2000 or so, all the search engines knew about were me and some piano player.
Since then, there was a movie called [The New Guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Guy), with some other [Ross Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Patterson) in a supporting role with [Eliza Dushku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Dushku).
Ah, we should all be so lucky.

For many years I was involved with [SHARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)), an IBM-oriented computer user group - in fact, the oldest computer user group.  I was also active in the [HTTP standardization effort](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ross+patterson%22+%22http-wg%22), among many other Internet-related activities.

I retired from the daily rat race in 2022, and am enjoying coding more than I have in years :-)
